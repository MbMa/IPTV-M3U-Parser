# IPTV M3U Parser

This is a Python script that can parse an IPTV M3U file, check connectivity, and extract accessible channels that match a set of specified channel names using regex pattern.
Requirements

This script requires Python 3 and the requests module, which can be installed via pip:

```
pip install requests
```

## Usage
>*To be able to use the script you need to provide first a **wanted.txt** file of your wanted channels, preferably by putting it in the same folder as the **iptv-parser.py** file.*

The script can be executed from the command line with the following arguments:

    -l or --local: Path of local M3U file (required if -r not provided)
    -r or --remote: URL of remote M3U file (required if -l not provided)
    -w or --wanted: Path to file containing channel names to extract (required, default: wanted.txt)
    -o or --output: Output M3U file name (optional, default : m3u-input-filename_output.m3u)
    -a or --accounts: Csv file name containing accounts playlists and info (optional, default : accounts.csv)

To execute the **iptv-parser.py** script with a local M3U file:

```bash
python iptv-parser.py -l path/to/local.m3u
```
or
```bash
python iptv-parser.py -l path/to/local.m3u -o path/to/output.m3u -w path/to/wanted.txt
```

To execute the script with a remote M3U file:

```bash
python iptv-parser.py -r http://remote.m3u
```

The script will read the specified channel names file, create a regex pattern, and use it to filter the channels from the M3U file. The accessible channels will be saved to the specified output file, and a list of accessible channels will be printed to the console.

## Batch mode
It is also possible with **batch.py** to parse multiple links or m3u local files by providing a **links.txt** file

The **batch.py** script can be executed from the command line with the following arguments:

    -l or --links: Path to the links file (optional, default: links.txt)

```bash
python batch.py -l links.txt
```
